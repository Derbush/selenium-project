What should we pay attention in a Selenium method?
1 - What does this method do
2 - What does this method return? Does it have a return type?
3 - Does it accept argument?
4 - Does it throw a specific exception?

---> .get(STRING URL) method
will get a give url
no return type
accept argument for url
can throw IllegalArgumentException if not provided with correct https /// URL

---> Basic navigations:
We combine navigate() method with some other methods  to achieve basic navigations.
navigate().forward()
navigate().back()
navigate().refresh()
navigate().to()

---> .getTitle();
gets the title
returns a String
no argument
no exceptions
good for confirming you are on the intended page

---> .Thread.sleep();
not Selenium method
comes from Java
stops codes execution for given direction

--> .getCurrentUrl();
gets url
returns String
no argument
no exceptions

--> manage().window.maximize(); // better to use, works for MAc and Windows
manage().window().fullscreen(); // for only MAC
opens full screen window


--> driver.close(); // closes only the currently focused window/tab
driver.quit(); // closes all of the opened browsers & end the session

New Session is created everytime we run our Selenium code.
We can end the session using driver.quite()
or it will naturaly end when the code execution is done
